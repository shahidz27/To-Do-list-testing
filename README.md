Testing Core Functionality
The project is testing core functionalities of a simple To-Do app, which includes adding, deleting, completing tasks, and validating input. These are basic features of a task management app, and testing them ensures the core functions work as expected.

2. Use of Fixtures
The sample_app fixture is a great way to ensure a fresh instance of the TodoApp class for each test, which ensures no side effects from previous tests.

3. Parameterized Tests
Using pytest.mark.parametrize for testing multiple tasks with a single function is efficient. It saves you from writing repetitive test cases for each task and ensures that all tasks are tested in one go.

4. Edge Case Testing
Testing for edge cases like empty task input (test_emptytask_notallowed) shows that you're thinking about input validation and ensuring that invalid input (like an empty string) is handled properly.

5. Coverage of Basic Use Cases
The tests cover a range of basic actions a user might do on a To-Do app, such as:

 Adding tasks.
 Deleting tasks.
 Completing tasks.
 Handling invalid input.
 Adding multiple tasks consecutively.
